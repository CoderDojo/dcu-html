Week 2 HTML Course - CoderDojo @ DCU
===================================

---------

* Key points to adding CSS style

* Add padding alignment to the body
* Add video to web page


Move CSS to its own file
------------------------

This week we created a centralized css file, we do this so
* Share styles with all our pages
* No need to duplicate styling across pages
* All pages will automatically look the same
* Quicker to develop great websites

To link a CSS file you use the link tag
* Use the href to link the file (Note the file name must be inside the double quotes)
* Close the link tag

	This is a link tag, linking to style.css
<pre>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"></link>
</pre>
