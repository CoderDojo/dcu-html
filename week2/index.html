			Welcome to the first Coderdojo session in DCU.  We have very few rules, but our main one
			is to be cool.  We will only teach areas that are cool such as web site, android, iPhone and
			game development. If there is something cool out there we have not seen let us know.
			
			This course will start with basics of HTML and then bring you on an adventure to 
			build what ever you imagination decides on the internet.
			
			Some of the most popular pages on the internet have:
